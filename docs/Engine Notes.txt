Engine notes:

=== Over all ===
- Need to change how resources are obtained (e.g. filepath).

=== Main engine ===
+ Haven't had to touch this much at all, as intended.

=== Event System ===
+ By far my favorite component of the entire engine thus far.
+ Very useful in thinning out the need for referencing objects.
~ Need to see how making Event.Listener an interface works out.
- Name clashes with other java libraries

=== Audio System ===
- Stream needs a way to better control various aspects, such as volume and stopping the stream.

=== Input System ===
- Screen scale not accounted for with mouse coordinates

=== Render Context ===
- No rotation yet!!
- Render/draw names aren't consistent. Decide on one.

=== Graphics ===
~ Sprite renderer component could have its positioning scheme looked into

=== Obj/Comp Graph ===
~ Perhaps there -can- be a use for inheriting GameObjects...?
- onAdd/onRemove/start/stop needs a better system
~ Untested but signs are pointing towards this being a good system

=== Console ===
+ Already useful
- Code is a bit clunky, needs to be redone
~ Should rethink how the in game console and System.out interact

=== Logging ===

=== Resource Management ===
+ Simple and straight forward

=== Physics ===
~ Largely untested

=== Scenes ===
~ Seem to work well?
